    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cup grape tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 bunch kale, roughly chopped into bite-sized pieced</li>
        <li>1/2 cucumber, chopped</li>
        <li>5 cup French bread (preferably day old), cubed</li>
        <li>2 tsp olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 shallot, chopped</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Stpes</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a sheet tray with aluminum foil and scatter the cherry tomatoes on top.
             Drizzle with a tsp of olive oil and roast for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>While the tomatoes are roasting, heat up a large skillet over medium high heat on the stove. Add the other tsp of olive oil and the cubed bread. Toss the bread well in the oil, so each cube of bread has some oil on it. Add a sprinkle of salt. Toast the bread, tossing constantly, for about five minutes or until bread turns golden. Remove from heat and place bread in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add chopped cucumber and kale to the bowl with the cubed bread. Toss. Add roasted tomatoes when they are out of the oven.</li>
        <li>To make the dressing, combine all ingredients in a glass jar {or small bowl}. Shake until creamy then drizzle over salad, tossing well to coat all of the bread and kale in dressing.</li>
        <li>Serve salad immediately or chilled</li>    
    </ol>
